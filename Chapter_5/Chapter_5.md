# Let's build a Web App
- Let's use the `search_for_letters` module and make it a web app.
- A web app is all about Requests and Responses.
    1. User enters address and does an action
    2. Action gets converted to a web request
    3. Server receives the request 
    4. Server sends response back
    5. Browser / App renders the response to User

- To build a working server-side web app, we need web-app framework.
- Let's install Flask.
    - `sudo python3 -m pip install flask`
